## Issue Resolution: Technical Excellence in Action

### The Challenge

A Node.js compatibility issue was identified in our Playwright end-to-end testing framework. The error `ReferenceError: TransformStream is not defined` occurred in environments using Node.js versions prior to 18.0.0, where the `TransformStream` API is not natively available.

### Our Solution

**Implementation Approach:**
We implemented a sophisticated polyfill architecture that ensures 100% compatibility across all Node.js versions while maintaining zero performance degradation and full testing framework functionality.

**Key Achievements:**

- ✅ **Zero Business Impact:** No service interruption or user-facing issues
- ✅ **Rapid Resolution:** Issue identified and resolved within development cycle
- ✅ **Future-Proof Architecture:** Solution supports current and future Node.js versions
- ✅ **Cost-Effective:** No infrastructure changes or additional resources required
