## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

### **Problem: "Cannot connect to backend"**

**Check:**
1. Backend environment variable `CORS_ORIGIN`
2. Should be: `https://advanciapayledger.com`
3. Update in Render → Backend → Environment
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for redeploy

### **Problem: "Registration failed"**

**Possible causes:**
- Backend database connection issue
- Check backend logs in Render
- Verify migrations ran successfully (7/7)

**Check backend logs:**
1. Render → advancia-backend → Logs
2. Look for registration POST request
3. Check for errors

### **Problem: "OTP not received"**

**Expected behavior:**
- OTP requires email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
- If not configured yet, OTP won't work
- Use email/password login instead for now

**To fix OTP later:**
- Configure email service in backend
- Add SMTP credentials to environment
- Test email sending

### **Problem: "Stuck on loading screen"**

**Check:**
1. Browser console (F12) for errors
2. Network tab for failed requests
3. Backend CORS allowing frontend domain

---

## 🧪 Test Commands (Backend):

### **Check if account was created:**

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
# Check backend health
curl https://advancia-backend.onrender.com/health

# Try to get user info (after login, with your token)
# Replace YOUR_TOKEN with actual token from localStorage
curl https://advancia-backend.onrender.com/api/users/YOUR_USER_ID `
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```
