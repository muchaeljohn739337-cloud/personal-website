# SMS Pool Integration Guide

## ✅ Twilio & WhatsApp Cleanup Complete

Twilio and WhatsApp services have been removed from the codebase. The system now uses **SMS Pool** for phone
verification.

## 🔧 SMS Pool Configuration

### 1. Get Your API Key

1. Visit [https://www.smspool.net/](https://www.smspool.net/)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Navigate to API section
4. Copy your API key

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Add these variables to your `backend/.env` file:

```env
# SMS Pool Configuration
SMSPOOL_API_KEY=SMSPOOL_fS2pMx2K7kxv2gotVOMPwQZEK8K9D0UG
SMSPOOL_SERVICE_ID=1  # 1 = Any service (default)
```

### 3. 🔐 Store Credentials in HashiCorp Vault (Recommended for Production)

For enhanced security, store SMS Pool credentials in Vault instead of environment variables:

**Step 1: Enable Vault**

In your `backend/.env` file:

```env
VAULT_ENABLED=true
VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:8200  # Or your Vault server address
VAULT_TOKEN=your-vault-token-here
VAULT_NAMESPACE=  # Optional
```

**Step 2: Run the Vault Storage Script**

```bash
cd backend
npx tsx scripts/store-smspool-in-vault.ts
```

This script will:

- ✅ Store `SMSPOOL_API_KEY` in Vault with 90-day rotation policy
- ✅ Store `SMSPOOL_SERVICE_ID` in Vault
- ✅ Create audit logs for compliance
- ✅ Encrypt credentials at rest

**Step 3: Verify Vault Storage**

The RPA config (`backend/src/rpa/config.ts`) automatically:

1. Tries to fetch credentials from Vault first
2. Falls back to environment variables if Vault is unavailable
3. Logs the retrieval method for transparency

**Benefits of Vault Storage:**

- 🔒 Automatic credential rotation (90-day policy)
- 📊 Complete audit trail of secret access
- 🔐 AES-256-CBC encryption at rest
- 👥 Admin-only access control
- 🚀 Zero-trust architecture

### 4. Service ID Options

The `SMSPOOL_SERVICE_ID` determines which service to use for verification:

- `1` - Any service (default, recommended)
- Specific service IDs can be found in SMS Pool documentation

## 📋 What Was Cleaned Up

### ✅ Removed Twilio References

The following Twilio-related configurations have been removed/replaced:

1. **Environment Variables** (removed from `.env.example`):
   - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
   - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
   - `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`
   - `TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID`

2. **RPA Configuration** (`backend/src/rpa/config.ts`):
   - Updated SMS provider from `twilio` to `smspool`
   - Replaced Twilio credentials with SMS Pool configuration

3. **Documentation** (`backend/src/rpa/README.md`):
   - Updated setup instructions to use SMS Pool instead of Twilio

### ✅ WhatsApp Support

WhatsApp integration was never implemented in the active codebase, so no cleanup was needed.

## 🚀 How SMS Pool Works

SMS Pool provides temporary phone numbers for SMS verification:

1. Request a phone number for verification
2. Display the number to the user
3. User receives SMS on that number
4. Retrieve the SMS code via API
5. Verify the code

## 📝 Implementation Status

| Feature               | Status         | Notes                                         |
| --------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend SMS UI       | ✅ Implemented | `frontend/src/components/SMSVerification.tsx` |
| Frontend API Client   | ✅ Implemented | `frontend/src/lib/smspool.ts`                 |
| Backend SMS Routes    | ✅ Implemented | `frontend/src/app/api/sms/`                   |
| SMS Verification Page | ✅ Implemented | `frontend/src/app/verify-sms/`                |
| Environment Config    | ✅ Updated     | `.env.example` includes SMS Pool vars         |
| Documentation         | ✅ Created     | `SMS_POOL_INTEGRATION.md` (frontend)          |

## 🔗 Frontend Integration

The frontend already has SMS Pool integration:

- **UI Component**: `frontend/src/components/SMSVerification.tsx`
- **API Client**: `frontend/src/lib/smspool.ts`
- **API Routes**: `frontend/src/app/api/sms/`
- **Verification Page**: `frontend/src/app/verify-sms/`
- **Documentation**: `frontend/SMS_POOL_INTEGRATION.md`

## 💰 Cost Comparison

| Service               | Typical Cost                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Twilio                | $0.0075 per SMS + phone number rental |
| SMS Pool              | Pay per verification (~$0.10-0.30)    |
| WhatsApp Business API | Setup fees + per-message costs        |

**SMS Pool Benefits**:

- No monthly fees
- No phone number rental
- Pay only for verifications
- No setup complexity

---

## 🧪 Testing

To test SMS verification:

1. Set `SMSPOOL_API_KEY` in backend `.env`
2. Start backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
3. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/verify-sms` page
5. Request a phone number
6. Check SMS Pool dashboard for received code
7. Enter code to verify

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

1. **Never commit** your `SMSPOOL_API_KEY` to Git
2. Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
3. SMS Pool API key should be kept secure
4. Rate limit verification requests to prevent abuse
